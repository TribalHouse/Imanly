# PRIVACY POLICY
**Last Updated: April 10, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Prayer Timing app ("the App").

## 1. PRIVACY-FIRST APPROACH

The Prayer Timing app is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle:
* We do not collect or store any user data on our servers
* All data is stored locally on your device only
* The app is completely ad-free
* We only process minimal information necessary for subscription renewals
* We do not track, profile, or monitor user behavior

## 2. INFORMATION STORAGE

Unlike most apps, we prioritize your privacy by:
* Storing all preferences, settings, and prayer time calculations directly on your device
* Never transmitting your personal data to our servers
* Not requiring account creation or login for basic functionality
* Not collecting analytics about how you use the app

## 3. LOCATION DATA

The App uses location data to:
* Calculate accurate prayer times based on your geographic location
* Show nearby mosques (if you use this feature)

Your location data is:
* Only processed on your device
* Never transmitted to our servers
* Never shared with third parties
* Only accessed when you use the app (not in the background)
* Completely optional - you can manually set your location in settings

## 4. SUBSCRIPTION INFORMATION

When you purchase a subscription or make in-app purchases:
* Payment information is processed solely by Apple App Store or Google Play Store
* We only receive confirmation of transaction success to enable premium features
* We do not have access to your payment details, credit card information, or billing address
* We only store the minimum information required to validate your subscription status

## 5. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The App may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you:
* Firebase (for minimal crash reporting)
* App Store/Google Play (for in-app purchases)

Each third-party service's use of your personal information is governed by their respective privacy policies. We limit our use of third-party services to the minimum necessary for app functionality.

## 6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 7. DATA SECURITY

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the limited data we process against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access.

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
